	Ctesibius was a poor, poor man who once lived in Alexandria. Even next to the Egyptians, whom the Greeks lorded over at that time, he was exceptionally poor. Yet, he was smart. Far smarter than the other geniuses of his age but unlike them, he was poor. So nobody remembers him. Even among the educated philosophers in Constantinople, if his name is brought up, they may simple shrug him off as the man who made the water clock. As such, they forget what he did for us. For my people. We are the Spartoi. We shall never be forgotten - we who were created by the teeth of the Three-Headed Serpent, slain by great Cadmus. Thank you, Ctesibius. We will always remember you.

	There are less of us created every year.
