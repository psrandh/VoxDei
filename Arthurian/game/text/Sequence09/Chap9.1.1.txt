	"It's time," said Palomedes. "Are you ready?"
	
	"I'm ready," nodded Deckard and the two went off.
	
	If thre was anybody who knew about the Questing Beast, it was Palomedes - the man had hunted the beast for years at this point. It was his destiny, he claimed. Tonight was the night when Palomedes would prove that. A brother of Grendel in more than just spirit, the Questing Beast was another son of that dark Naiad of the DÃ­sir once known as Calliope. Yes, it was Calliope, consort of Mars, whom many said Beowulf smote in her cave, though a few dark whispers had claimed something more sinister had been afoot. Deckard wasn't there and so he had no hope of knowing the truth, what he did know was that the Questing Beast had slain several soldiers of the South Saxons under the charge of Cymen. If Deckard and Palomedes did not bring the beast back, dead or alive, then war was inevitable.
