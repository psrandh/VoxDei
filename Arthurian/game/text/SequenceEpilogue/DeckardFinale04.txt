	She was there, with the waters of Lethe in her hands, standing over the mystic river as it seemed to trail from one end of infinity to the other. She raised the waters up to her mouth and Deckard placed his hand on her shoulder. As if she knew it were him, she dropped the water back into Lethe. "Now, why would you ever even consider such a thing?" he asked, with a chuckle. "I'm sure life without me wasn't that bad."
	
	"You should try it," she smiled, turning around to him. "It's worse than you think."
	
	"So, my dear," he said, giving her a massive hug, "where do we go from here?"
	
	"In eleven years, Nimue said," she spoke as if she were choking on her own blood. "In eleven years, all of this ends."
	
	"In eleven, maybe but I've seen futures where we delay it," he said. "It ends no matter what."
	
	"I know," she nodded her head. "No matter what we do, the dream dies.
	
	"There's nothing for us here," said Deckard. "We may as well drink from Lethe and move on."
	
	"Just because the dream falls here, doesn't mean it has to die," she told him. "We can leave. We can go to Gaul, to the Germanic kingdoms, Hispania or far beyond any of it and spread the word of the dream. We can keep it alive."
	
	"We can save the dream," he nodded and he pressed his forehead to her's as Lethe retreated into the oblivion of nothing behind them.
	
	"Will you help us leave Britannia?" asked Raechelle, turning to Nimue.
	
	"For the dream," she nodded and for that moment, all was calm.
