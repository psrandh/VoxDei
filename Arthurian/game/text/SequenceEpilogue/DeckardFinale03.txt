	She was there, with the waters of Lethe in her hands, standing over the mystic river as it seemed to trail from one end of infinity to the other. She raised the waters up to her mouth and Deckard placed his hand on her shoulder. As if she knew it were him, she dropped the water back into Lethe. "Now, why would you ever even consider such a thing?" he asked, with a chuckle. "I'm sure life without me wasn't that bad."
	
	"You should try it," she smiled, turning around to him. "It's worse than you think."
	
	"So, my dear," he said, giving her a massive hug, "where do we go from here?"
	
	"In eleven years, Nimue said," she spoke as if she were choking on her own blood. "In eleven years, all of this ends."
	
	"In eleven, maybe but I've seen futures where we delay it," he said. "We can change it."
	
	"No," she shook her head. "It'll come. I know it. It doesn't matter when. It doesn't matter how old we are. Arthur's dream will fall at Camlann - with or without us."
	
	"Then what do you say we do?" he asked.
	
	"Just because the dream falls, doesn't mean it has to die," she told him. "We can mitigate the battle. It doesn't have to be the bloody affair we saw, maybe we can't change the future permanently but we can augment it. Make it what we want to be."
	
	"We can save the dream," he nodded and he pressed his forehead to her's as Lethe retreated into the oblivion of nothing behind them.
	
	"Will you help us?" asked Raechelle, turning to Nimue.
	
	"For the dream," she nodded and for that moment, all was calm.
