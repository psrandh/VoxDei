	She was there, with the waters of Lethe in her hands, standing over the mystic river as it seemed to trail from one end of infinity to the other. She raised the waters up to her mouth and Deckard placed his hand on her shoulder. As if she knew it were him, she dropped the water back into Lethe. "Now, why would you ever even consider such a thing?" he asked, with a chuckle. "I'm sure life without me wasn't that bad."
	
	"You should try it," she smiled, turning around to him. "It's worse than you think."
	
	"So, my dear," he said, giving her a massive hug, "where do we go from here?"
	
	"In eleven years, Nimue said," she spoke as if she were choking on her own blood. "In eleven years, all of this ends."
	
	"In eleven, maybe but I've seen futures where we delay it," he said. "We can change it."
	
	"No," she shook her head. "It'll come. I know it. It doesn't matter when. It doesn't matter how old we are. Arthur's dream will fall at Camlann - with or without us."
	
	"No," he refuted, "I know we can change the future. One delay, two delay, three - it doesn't matter. There's something that converges Britannia back to a bloody battle at Camlann. We change that and we change our fate for good."
	
	"Then the dream doesn't have to fall?" she asked, more herself than him, as if trying to comprehend if what he said was even possible.
	
	"We can save the dream and it will thrive in Britannia," he nodded and he pressed his forehead to her's as Lethe retreated into the oblivion of nothing behind them.
	
	"Will you help us?" asked Raechelle, turning to Nimue.
	
	"For the dream," she nodded and for that moment, all was calm.
