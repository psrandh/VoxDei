	"You're not Raechelle," said Kahedin, backing away from her slowly. What? What on Earth did he mean. Raechelle knew that Kahedin was hurting, that everything was confusing. As if on instinct, she reache dout for him to comfort him. She stopped dead in her tracks when he pulled out his sword on her and leveled it steady to her neck. "Give me one reason, monster, why I shouldn't kill you right now?"
	
	"Kahedin, what are you talking about?" she asked, still more concerned for him than for herself.
	
	"Please... I'm begging you... I'm begging you to give me one reason to let you live," he said, practically whimpering. "I don't want to kill you... even if you are clay..."
	
	"Clay," whispered Raechelle and her eyes widened in realization. "No!" Then, she was feral. No! This couldn't be true! It couldn't! It just wasn't possible! She had memories, she could remember yesterday, the day before, the month, year, decade and quarter century before! She wasn't made of clay! She wasn't a pastiche created in the image of a dead woman by the Augurs. She couldn't be! The clay didn't love but she did. She loved Deckard... she knew it.
	
	"I'm begging you," choked Kahedin and then Raechelle snapped out of it and she saw his blood on her hands. She saw his throat in her grip and his sword impaled into the wall with an inhuman power. She saw the blue bottle on her dresser and she knew why Nemea had given her sister. The world would end in twelve years but her world had ended today, on the eve of the Battle of Mearcred's Burn. Raechelle didn't know when she released Kahedin, she only knew she was running with Lethe in her hand.
