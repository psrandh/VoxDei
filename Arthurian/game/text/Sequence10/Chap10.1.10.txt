	Wlencing stepped up to the plate but within seconds, Deckard could tell that the Saxon had bit off more than he could chew. King Arthur was not just any swordsman, he was a legendary hero. Perhaps the only swordsman greater than him was Lancelot and if Wlencing was faring this badly against Arthur, then what hope did he have against that one? From the brief moment Deckard had spent in battle against Cymen, it was clear which prince of the South Saxons had been the better duelist. As good as Wlencing was, he was losing ground to Arthur and was just growing more and more frustrated by it.
