	Wlencing paced around the room a little, as far as Deckard could tell. Then, Wlencing paced around a little faster and with a bit of a manic rush. "But if I had to guess," said Deckard and immediately Wlencing stopped. Good. The mad prince was waiting for him to talk.
	
	"Yes? If you had to guess?" Wlencing asked without sparing a breath, his face a mite's distance away from Deckard.
	
	"Maybe the Romans want one solid empire back," said Deckard, "I've heard stories of war between the Romans and Sasanians. Maybe they want to be the power they once were, when the Sasanians were the Parthians." In truth, Deckard didn't know if any of this was true or not. It was conjecture, things that he picked up in taverns or town halls from would be merchants claiming to have come from distant lands with news. The point was, Constantinople was so far away that Wlencing had as good a hope at verifying the truth of the matter as Deckard.
	
	"Get to the point, I've heard all of this," growled Wlencing, pressing his cool steel dagger to Deckard's bound hand.
	
	"Naiads are beasts from Greece," said Deckard. "Maybe the Romans of Constantinople sent this Naiad as a scout before an invasion of Britannia?"
	
	"That... actually sounds quite reasonable," muttered Wlencing, sounding like a real person for the first time. "You see, I've heard rumours all tied together by the name Lucius Tiberius. Do you know this name?"
	
	"No," lied Deckard.
	
	"Then let me educate you!" Wlencing gleefully clapped. "Yes, the Procurator of Constantinople. Word has it, he's gone to a lot of kings to demand tribute for his emperor."
