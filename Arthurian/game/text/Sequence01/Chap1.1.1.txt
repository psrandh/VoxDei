	"One of King Arthur's soldier boys, are you?" laughed Wlencing. "My, oh my, oh my! This changes things entirely! Ah Cymen, he died bringing us the war that only he wanted." Then, Wlencing stepped back into the darkness behind the torture. He made a noise that sounded like contained laughter but it gave way soon and the cell was filled with his malignant laughs. "This is just too good!"
	
	"If you're going to execute me, get on with it then," grunted Deckard.
	
	"That's what the old man would want, I think," nodded Wlencing. "So, I think shall... but first, riddle me this. What's big and Geatish but triumphant and dead?"
	
	"Beowulf," answered Deckard.
	
	"Correct!" snapped Wlencing. "Beowulf the Dragon-Slayer!"
	
	"What's the point of this?" asked Deckard.
	
	"You see, you were found alongside a Naiad, now she's refused to talk to me!" giggled Wlencing. "Already dear soldier, you've been so much more co-operative... but,a s you asked, the point. The point is, Beowulf proved to us that there is more than just us, the world is beyond just us! Your very Arthur is distracted from his war against Urien by Leodegrance and his brood! We have rumours that Verona is making a pact with demonkin against Zeno! I have heard word of the mythical land of Bharat, where everyday people find servants of the Shaitan in glass bottles! Yet here at the end of the world, what did we have?"
	
	"Nimue," said Deckard. He didn't want to play along with this madman but for the sake of keeping his fingers while he could, he felt it best to do so.
	
	"Correct again!" he laughed. "Nimue is a source of magic, think now little tin soldier... what is this Naiad doing if this place on Earth already has Nimue?"
	
	"I don't know."
	
	"Neither do I!"
