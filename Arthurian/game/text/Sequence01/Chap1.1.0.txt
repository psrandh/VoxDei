	Wehn Deckard awoke, he couldn't see anything. At first, he thought he may have been blinded but it soon became clear that he was just in a gaol devoid of light. he was chained against a wall in a fashion that he was elevated and his arms were linked at opposite ends of the wall, forcing him to lean forward with his head in the air. It was a Saxon gaol, he knew and very likely the gaoler was in the very same room with him. "If you're going to interrogate me," he sighed, "just do it."
	
	"With pleasure," said the gaoler and with that, he lit a torch and brought it close to Deckard's face. The first thing the noble did was look at himself, he had been stripped of his weapons and armour. He was totally at the mercy of the gaoler. If Deckard hadn't been hardened by years of combat, then his heart would have dropped when he realized the gaoler was none other than Wlencing, Ã†lle's thirdborn son and the cruelest of all of them. "How did you kill my brother and fourteen great South Saxon soldiers?"
	
	"I didn't," answered Deckard and he found himself reeling after an elbow to the temple from Wlencing.
	
	"Sorry, that was actually my seventh question, I just got so carried away!" squealed Wlencing and through the flame of the torch, Deckard could make out his giddy grin. "You know, it's around that time that you Welsh keep resisting and I'm allowed to hurt you but... soldier, when I do hurt you, please know that it really does hurt me a lot more than it hurts you?"
	
	"What...," gasped Deckard as he felt his mouth bleed from the strike.
	
	"Okay, well, you see... how do I put this? Oh yes!" cheered Wlencing. "Physically, it hurts you but mentally, oh I am just shattered!"
	
	"What... is your question?" muttered Deckard.
	
	"Let's start, and properly this time, with who are you?"
