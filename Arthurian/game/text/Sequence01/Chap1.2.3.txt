	The theory that Deckard could tell Wlencing was getting on was not incredulous, but it made no real sense for Lucius Tiberius to go and visit various kings. Odoacer of Italy lready directly paid tribute to Zeno. Euric of the Visigoths was a tyrant and partially responsible for the situation between Arthur and Urien and so, Deckard saw no possible way that he would ever pay tribute to Rome. Clovis and Gunthamund were different and could possibly be persuaded to do so under the right terms and conditions.
	
	"I'm so glad you came to the same conclusion as me," said Wlencing. "It spares me from having to kill you like the old man wants me to. Tell you what, if you agree to do a service for me, I will pardon you of your crime."
	
	"Pardon me of the murder of your elder brother?" asked Deckard.
	
	"Well, you already said you didn't do it! Who am I to say you're a liar!" laughed Wlencing. "Now, now... what I have to ask you forest boy, is this... when I set you free, I will also set free the Naiad just to show what a good man I am. Two already dead corpses will be buried in your names. On your honour, you find out the truth about Lucius Tiberius and you tell me and you are free to go."
	
	"You don't even know my name," said Deckard.
	
	"Woah, it's almost like you want to die," laughed Wlencing. "Well, Welshman... it doesn't matter. Without Cymen, there will be no more hunts against your people. With one swift move though, I could have them all killed."
	
	Deckard looked up at Wlencing and stared the Saxon in the eyes. He would do it.
	
	"War will be unavoidable," said Wlencing. "I will lead my father's armies to avenge Cymen's death and will murder every Welshman or woman I see in the Wildwood. We will take the children and educate them as Saxons. If Arthur intervenes, it will be seen as an act of war and we will decimate Camelot."
	
	"I accept," said Deckard, and Wlencing smiled in a manner most unbefitting of the savage he had presented himself as.
