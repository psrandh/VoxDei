Now we must praise Heaven-kingdom's Guardian, the Measurer's might and his mind-plans, the work of the Glory Father, when he of wonders of every one, eternal Lord, the beginning established.

He first created for men's sons Heaven as a roof, holy creator; then middle-earth mankind's Guardian, eternal Lord, afterwards made - for men earth, Master almighty.
