	"Hold!" came a voice behind the pair once were a ways into the forest. As if on instinct, they both pulled out our swords and held them up against the voice from behind them before stopping our horses. "Really? Don't you recognize my voice?"
	
	"Of course I recognize your voice," Deckard answered as Lucan came into sight. "However, dryads have been sighted in these woods. Never know with them."
	
	"Do I look like a bloody dryad?" scoffed Lucan.
	
	"No," said Deckard. "Why are you here?"
	
	"Do you really think Arthur would trust the safety of his nephew against Cymen with just you?" asked Lucan. "He was disappointed when I didn't speak up at the Round Table. I don't want to be here, three knights away from the war is enough chaos."
	
	"But my uncle desires this business with Cymen be resolved," said Mordred. "So, we will resolve it."
	
	"Will we?" laughed Lucan. "Boy, all killing Cymen will do is give the South Saxons the excuse they've been looking for to go to war. Your uncle doesn't understand that the moment Cymen's body is found, the South Saxons will leap to an alliance with King Urien."
	
	Deckard could see the anger on Mordred's face but he also knew, Lucan was right. Even if they could kill Cymen, that would only bring Ã†lle into the fray. Where the South Saxons were fresh and begging for battle, the Welsh were already sick and tired of it. The entry of the South Saxons would only serve to collapse whatever Roman rule remained in Britain and would allow the Saxons as a whole to subsume the island.
	
	"Regardless, do you bring any word from Camelot?" Deckard asked as the three of them rode on deeper into the forest.
	
	"Yes, we found King Leodegrance, all that's left now is to bring him into Castle Camelot," said Lucan and he turned to face Mordred. "Ever faced a vampire, boy?"
	
	"No," answered Mordred.
	
	"Well, they aren't pretty daywalkers like your aunt," laughed Lucan. "I'd advise you sit that raid out."
