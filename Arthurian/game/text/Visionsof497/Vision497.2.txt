At first, the vision seemed to be the exact same and in truth, it was. However, there was a lot more detail this time. Not everything in sight seemed to be consumed by the carnage and blood. Not every sound seemed to revolve around the moans of the dead and dying. Maybe the vision was more detailed or maybe, prior exposure to the more horrific parts of the vision had made them seem less cruel this time around.
