It was similar this time but it was a little different. The carnage had not changed and the wounded were still moaning an endless symphony of pain. The sky was no longer bright, though and it was red, with a giant chimney of smoke blowing up into the air. The fortress of Camboglanna was on fire as the Picts surrounding it catapulted flaming barrels of oil at the building that once marked Roman domination. In the distance, it seemed as if packs of wild wolves and vultures had begun to congregate in wait for the battle to end to give them enough bodies for what could be an eternal feast.

On the battlefield itself, Arthur still fought the giant Pict, but both were visibly older. Arthur seemed even stronger than he had in the very first vision, almost as if he had been given time to train and prepare for this day. His form with the Red Death was impeccable and his muscles rippled through the mail armour whereas in the original vision, he had just neatly fit in it. However, his hair had completely greyed. In the prior vision, it had not greyed enough to even really warrant notice except in comparison to the Pict, who seemed to be exactly the same in this vision. There was just one difference: Excalibur. The Pict was using Excalibur!

As if they were following Arthur's lead, the warriors of Camelot were fighting better this time around. They did not have the Picts on the defensive, but they were positioned almost evenly with Arthur this time. Many of the Mounted Nobles still lived and guided their forces as Camboglanna burned behind them. From what could be told, though, this was all only temporary. For as well trained as Camelot's forces were, one dead Pict only seemed to bring two more. They hadn't changed the end of the world, they had just made it a little bit easier to bear.
