	The woman got up from her knees. When the nobles had first seen her, they hadn't the time to take much notice of her but they saw now what she was. The blood soaked her white dress but neither of those things drew the mens' eyes away from her green eyes. Not green as in the iris was coloured that way, but green as in it seemed to be as if her eyes were almost made of an emerald fire. The colour was shifting here or there, but there was no mistaking who she was. This wasn't just a normal hunt of Cymen's for this woman was no Roman or Briton.
	
	"A Naiad," whispered Mordred to Lucan, with the similarly entranced noble merely nodding.
	
	"Are you a sister of Nimue?" asked Deckard, keeping his sword steady in his hand.
	
	"You shouldn't have come," she whispered.
	
	"What?"
	
	"Get out of here!" she cried as the buzzing sound grew louder. Louder. And Louder. She kept screaming but it seemed as if she was saying nothing. Deckard couldn't hear her, nor could he hear Lucan or Mordred. He turned to them as Mordred fell to a blow from the hilt of a Saxon sword. They were surrounded. About eighteen Saxon soldiers. When did this happen? How did they get here so close without being noticed by them? Deckard felt sluggish, like he couldn't move. He turned back to the Naiad and she whispered something and Deckard fell to his knees as that horrible beast that Palomedes had hunted came into sight. His vision started darkening and he focused on the barking beast and he heard several faint shrieks, all drowning out under the buzzing.	
	
	The last thing Deckard saw before he vision was all black was Lucan, riding out on his horse with Mordred slumped out behind him. 
	
	"Raechelle," whispered Deckard and he passed out, slumping down onto the ground surrounded by a pool of Saxon blood.
